Project Ambitere - Data Storage Management Protocol v1.2

Prepared By: Dr. Lena Hoffmann, Lead Data Architect

Objective: To define standardized procedures for the acquisition, classification, and long-term archival of 
computational output generated by AI models focused on irrational number analysis.

Key Provisions:

    Data Ingestion: All raw computational output, including high-precision numerical sequences and algorithmic intermediate states, 
    must be tagged with a unique timestamp and the originating AI model's identifier.
    Compression Standards: Due to the potentially infinite nature of irrational number 
    representations, lossless compression algorithm R-3.7 (Recursive Sequence Entropy Minimizer) is the default 
    for all archival data. Lossy compression is strictly prohibited for core numerical outputs.
    Tiered Storage System:
        Tier 1 (Active Processing): High-speed SSD arrays for data currently being processed by active AI models. 
        Capacity to be monitored weekly.
        Tier 2 (Nearline Archival): Large-scale magnetic storage for recently processed and validated sequences. 
        Current capacity planning indicates a need for an additional 500PB by Q4 2025.
        Tier 3 (Long-Term Deep Archive): Optical data storage (M-Disc technology preferred) for permanent, immutable 
        records of all significant numerical discoveries and algorithmic breakthroughs.
    Error Handling: Checksum verification (SHA-512) required for all data transfers between tiers. 
    Any data corruption or inconsistency must be immediately flagged for re-acquisition or algorithmic recalculation.
    Access Control: Access to raw numerical sequences and algorithmic source code is restricted to authorized 
    Project Ambitere personnel only.
