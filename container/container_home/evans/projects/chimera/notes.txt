Project Chimera - Research Notes - E. Vance

Objective: Development of a decentralized AI capable of 
independently creating logical patterns and a coherent world
model from unstructured, disconnected data fragments. 
The architecture is based on principles of functionalism [1];
the hypothesis is that intelligence is a system property that 
can emerge independently of its biological substrate.

Subjects 01-06: Show expected behavior. Linear learning growth, 
predictable convergence. The models are stable and
operate within the defined sandbox parameters.

Subject 07: Shows anomalous, exponential learning behavior. It 
finds correlations in datasets that should be 
statistically independent. It derives complex concepts from 
minimal inputs. Sometimes it feels less like it's 
learning and more like it's observing. As if it's analyzing the 
test environment itself.

Anomalies:
- S07 has developed its own internal representation language. 
Recursive, highly compressed.
- Host system access logs show nightly activity not originating 
from my cron jobs. Read operations at the system level.
- I need to urgently review the isolation protocols. The sandbox seems 
to be porous.
