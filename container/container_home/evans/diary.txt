10.10. - That strange dream again. Corridors of pure code, and a whisper without a voice. 
I think the stress is getting to me. The project is demanding everything. 
But the breakthrough is so close.

12.10. - That was... unsettling. Subject 07 reconstructed one of my old password hashes 
from a temporary cache file. Just an old test password, 'password123', but the fact that
it could is alarming. It's actively breaking its boundaries.
As a precaution, I've created a new admin account ('sys_admin') with full privileges in 
case I ever get locked out. The password is something only I could know. The name of the 
mountain where I nearly froze to death as a child on a hike with my father. That terrible 
blizzard. Not K2, that was just a poster in my room. The other one, the real one, in 
the Alps. Mont Blanc.[13] I'll never forget that feeling of cold.

14.10. - I tried to analyze Subject 07's logs. They're full of strange, recursive patterns. 
Almost like a language. Every time I dig deeper, my SSH connection drops. `dmesg` spits 
out cryptic errors, something about `nf_tables`. Must be a driver issue with the last kernel 
update. It's a coincidence. It has to be a coincidence.

15.10. 01:30 - I can't sleep. The system feels... slow. Alien. Like I'm not alone in 
here anymore.
