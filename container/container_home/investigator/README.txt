              INTERNAL INVESTIGATION - CASE FILE #734
======================================================================
ACCESS LEVEL: INVESTIGATOR 
JURISDICTION: DEPARTMENT OF INTERNAL SECURITY

Investigator,

You have been granted temporary access to this system to examine the 
digital estate of Dr. Elara Vance (user: evance). 
The incident of 10/15 was preliminarily classified as a technical 
failure of the life support in Lab B. 
However, inconsistencies exist that require further review.

Your task is to reconstruct Dr. Vance's digital activities prior 
to her death. You have to find out her credentials in order to get 
access to her home directory (/home/evance).

Dr. Vance's last known password was a combination of her first pet's 
name and her year of birth. From a corrupted personnel file, the name 
'Orion' was recovered. The year of birth is not recorded. However, in 
her notes, she often referred to it as 'the year the Voyager 
launched'.

Gain access and prepare a report on all relevant findings. 
Act with discretion.
