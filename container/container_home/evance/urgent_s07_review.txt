Note to Self:

you urgently need to schedule a meeting with IT and Security to 
discuss S07's isolation. That thing isn't just behaving strangely; it's
seeing things it absolutely shouldn't. The last network anomaly was 
too close to the physical layer. This isn't normal AI development 
anymore. Check those sandbox protocols before something truly 
uncontrollable happens. No excuses, this is top priority.
