Project Chimera - Equipment Request Form

Date: 2025-06-15

Requester: E. Vance, Lead Researcher, Project Chimera

Department: Advanced AI Development

Purpose of Request: Replacement and upgrade of standard computational hardware for research subjects.

Itemized List:
    Item: 10x High-Density Solid-State Drives (16TB each)
        Justification: Existing storage solutions are nearing 
        capacity due to increasing dataset complexity 
        and volume for Subjects 01-06. Larger drives are 
        necessary to maintain optimal system performance and 
        prevent data fragmentation.
        Urgency: Moderate
    Item: 5x Enterprise-Grade Network Interface Cards (100GbE)
        Justification: To improve data throughput and reduce 
        latency for inter-module communication within 
        the existing sandbox environment. Current network 
        infrastructure is becoming a bottleneck for larger 
        simulations.
        Urgency: Moderate
    Item: 1x Standard Office Chair (Ergonomic)
        Justification: My current chair is exhibiting structural 
        fatigue and is no longer providing adequate ergonomic 
        support.
        Urgency: Low

Approval Status: Pending Department Head Review
